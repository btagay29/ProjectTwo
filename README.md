# Words In Motion
by Bryan Tagay

# Project Overview

Inspired by my experience of community, I chose the song "I Can Only Bliss Out (F'Days)" by Laraaji. Each lyrical line guided the animations created for each page. 

# Technical Overview

Comprised are a total of eight pages utilizing HTML and CSS styling. CSS keyframe and transform properties are the primary modes for creating each animation.
